# youtubeSides
An Open Source list - status and discernment of various iOS, YouTube iPA Tweaks
## Original Reddit Post:
[Clearing Up YouTube Options?](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/comments/1dy9v4s/clearing_up_youtube_options/) - https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/comments/1dy9v4s/clearing_up_youtube_options/
## What this is/is not
This is just a collection and suggestion of the many available YouTube Tweaks and iPAs. 
This <b>is not</b>:
- A support page or official communications for any of these.
- Support for sideloading in general nor the installtion of these applications on iOS.
- Offically affliated with any of these projects.
- A place to get a link or file directly to a finished build/release/etc. Only links to the projects themselves (GH Repos, as offical as a website that can be found, etc).

Please Note: 
- Use of Adblockers is currently and has been against YouTube's TOS. You use any of these at your own risk/discretion.
- AppDB has multiple submissions from multiple people, so it's best if possible to build and sign apps yourself as directly from either the 🏆🔗 (Reccomended link) or official repo.

## Considerations

- YTLite
- YTLitePlus/+ 🔱🏆

## 🚧 Considerations Explained/Expanded
Note: Regarding uYouPlus & uYouEnhanced from uyouplus.com -
The page includes both a uYouPlus and uYouEnhanced links but share the same About page (it looked like they were different/seperate sites but they aren't).
